Mtcars, the automobile company in the United States, has planned to rework on optimizing the horsepower of its cars as most of the   
customersâ€™ feedback was centred around horsepower.   
However, while developing an ML model with respect to horsepower, the efficiency of the model was compromised.   
Irregularity might be one of the causes.  
  

Objective: Check for missing values and outliers within the horsepower column and remove them.
